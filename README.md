# KotiBot Sensor

This is a simple app to collect data from I2C BME280 sensor that provides data for temperature, air pressure and humidity. It can be run on Raspberry Pi and scheduled i.e. with PM2. See ecosystem.config.js.sample file for sample pm2 configuration.

You can use i.e. [kotibot-web](https://github.com/tlaukkanen/kotibot-web) as a receiving server.
